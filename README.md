# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code for Horiseon Marketing Agency's website. By doing so, their codebase now follows accessibility standards and their site is optimized for search engines. Through consolidation and other skills, I was able to practice refactoring code so its webpage can meet accessibility standards.
